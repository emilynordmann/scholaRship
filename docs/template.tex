\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Overview}

\texttt{scholaRship} is a collection of tutorials on how to engage in the scholarship of teaching and learning using quantitative methods and R. It is written by Learning, Teaching, and Scholarship focused academics in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience and the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow.

This book should be considered a living document. The tutorials will be added over time as they are developed and both the content and structure of new and existing tutorials may be updated.

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

Getting started with the scholarship of teaching and learning can be difficult. For the majority of academics whose subject expertise does not involve learning and teaching, the first hurdle of figuring out what questions you can ask and answer (and indeed are interested in) can be the toughest one to push past.

Once you have settled on an area of enquiry, you may find that the most appropriate methodologies to investigate your questions are not ones you have been trained in. For quantitatively-minded researchers, the availability of data can feel like simultaneous feast and famine - you may have access to huge amounts of data through learning analytics and standard student records but will be able to use almost none of it for research purposes due to the need for opt-in consent. Where such consent has been obtained, you may have small, non-representative samples and/or non-random attrition.

Finally, the data you do have can be seriously messy: missing data, data from multiple sources with different structures and labels, data from different academic years where course structures and assessments have changed, anonymised data, or aggregated data.

If any of this sounds familiar, this book is for you.

Each tutorial in this book will contain:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A short summary of the \textbf{evidence-base} for the problem under investigation to promote engagement with the SoTL literature;
\item
  \textbf{Real}\footnote{\textbf{Due to the need for ethical approval, the data we use in this book won't be strictly real data, instead, it will be a simulated, synthetic copy of real data. All the mess, none of the consent issues.}} messy, imperfect data drawn from commonly available sources such as Moodle, Turnitin, Microsoft Forms, and Echo360;
\item
  A walkthrough of how to \textbf{clean and wrangle} the data using a predominantly \texttt{tidyverse} approach;
\item
  A walkthrough of how to \textbf{analyse}, \textbf{interpret, and}, and \textbf{write-up} the analysis, alongside an honest discussion of the limitations of the approach used.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{expectations-of-prior-knowledge}{%
\section{Expectations of prior knowledge}\label{expectations-of-prior-knowledge}}

\hypertarget{r-and-rstudio}{%
\subsection{R and RStudio}\label{r-and-rstudio}}

Minimal prior knowledge of R and RStudio is assumed throughout this book. All functions and code used will be explained, however, we assume that the reader understands how to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Install R and RStudio
\item
  Navigate RStudio
\item
  Set the working directory appropriately
\item
  Install and load packages
\item
  Write and execute code
\end{itemize}

For any reader that wishes to recap these skills, the appendix contains resources on how to install R and RStudio, and an introduction to R and RStudio.

\hypertarget{research-methods-and-statistics}{%
\subsection{Research methods and statistics}\label{research-methods-and-statistics}}

We assume a basic level of competency in research methods and statistics. However, we also recognise that many researchers are still less familiar with more modern approaches such as mixed effects models and will provide an appropriate level of explanation and further resources where necessary.

\hypertarget{appendix-appendices}{%
\appendix}


\hypertarget{installing-r}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{Installing \texttt{R}}{Installing R}}\label{installing-r}}

Installing R and RStudio is usually straightforward. The sections below explain how and \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKMsaWju8w}{there is a helpful YouTube video here}.

\hypertarget{installing-base-r}{%
\section{Installing Base R}\label{installing-base-r}}

\href{https://cran.rstudio.com/}{Install base R}. Choose the download link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows).

If you have a Mac, install the latest release from the newest \texttt{R-x.x.x.pkg} link (or a legacy version if you have an older operating system). After you install R, you should also install \href{http://xquartz.macosforge.org/}{XQuartz} to be able to use some visualisation packages.

If you are installing the Windows version, choose the ``\href{https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/}{base}'' subdirectory and click on the download link at the top of the page. After you install R, you should also install \href{https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/}{RTools}; use the ``recommended'' version highlighted near the top of the list.

If you are using Linux, choose your specific operating system and follow the installation instructions.

\hypertarget{installing-rstudio}{%
\section{Installing RStudio}\label{installing-rstudio}}

Go to \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\#download}{rstudio.com} and download the RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) version for your operating system under the list titled \textbf{Installers for Supported Platforms}.

\hypertarget{rstudio-settings}{%
\section{RStudio Settings}\label{rstudio-settings}}

There are a few settings you should fix immediately after updating RStudio. Go to \textbf{\texttt{Global\ Options...}} under the \textbf{\texttt{Tools}} menu (⌘,), and in the General tab, uncheck the box that says \textbf{\texttt{Restore\ .RData\ into\ workspace\ at\ startup}}. If you keep things around in your workspace, things will get messy, and unexpected things will happen. You should always start with a clear workspace. This also means that you never want to save your workspace when you exit, so set this to \textbf{\texttt{Never}}. The only thing you want to save are your scripts.

You may also want to change the appearance of your code. Different fonts and themes can sometimes help with visual difficulties or \href{https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2017/09/coding-and-dyslexia}{dyslexia}.

\caption{RStudio General and Appearance settings}\label{fig:settings-general}
\end{figure}

You may also want to change the settings in the Code tab. Foe example, Lisa prefers two spaces instead of tabs for my code and likes to be able to see the whitespace characters. But these are all a matter of personal preference.

\hypertarget{installing-latex}{%
\section{Installing LaTeX}\label{installing-latex}}

You can install the LaTeX typesetting system to produce PDF reports from RStudio. Without this additional installation, you will be able to produce reports in HTML but not PDF. This course will not require you to make PDFs. To generate PDF reports, you will additionally need to install tinytex \citep{R-tinytex} and run the following code:

\hypertarget{glossary-1}{%
\chapter{Glossary}\label{glossary-1}}

You can use the \texttt{glossary()} function to automatically link to a term in the \href{https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/}{psyTeachR glossary} or make your own project-specific glossary.

This will create a link to the glossary and include a tooltip with a short definition when you hover over the term. Use the following syntax in inline r: \texttt{glossary("word")}. For example, common data types are integer, double, and character.

If you need to link to a definition, but are using a different form of the word, add the display version as the second argument (\texttt{display}). You can also override the automatic short definition by providing your own in the third argument (\texttt{def}). Add the argument \texttt{link\ =\ FALSE} if you just want the hover definition and not a link to the psyTeachR glossary.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{glossary}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data type"}\NormalTok{, }
         \AttributeTok{display =} \StringTok{"Data Types"}\NormalTok{, }
         \AttributeTok{def =} \StringTok{"My custom definition of data types"}\NormalTok{, }
         \AttributeTok{link =} \ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

{[}1{]} ``Data Types''

You can add a glossary table to the end of a chapter with the following code. It creates a table of all terms used in that chapter previous to the \texttt{glossary\_table()} function. It uses \texttt{kableExtra()}, so if you use it in a code chunk, set \texttt{results=\textquotesingle{}asis\textquotesingle{}}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{glossary\_table}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
term & definition\\
\hline
character & A data type representing strings of text.\\
\hline
data-type & My custom definition of data types\\
\hline
double & A data type representing a real decimal number\\
\hline
integer & A data type representing whole numbers.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

If you want to contribute to the glossary, fork the \href{https://github.com/PsyTeachR/glossary}{github project}, add your terms and submit a pull request, or suggest a new term at the \href{https://github.com/PsyTeachR/glossary/issues}{issues page}.
