`scholaRship` is a collection of tutorials on how to engage in the scholarship of teaching and learning using quantitative methods and R. It is written by Learning, Teaching, and Scholarship focused academics in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience and the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow.

This book should be considered a living document. The tutorials will be added over time as they are developed and both the content and structure of new and existing tutorials may be updated.
